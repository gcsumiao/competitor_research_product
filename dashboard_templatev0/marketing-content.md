# Rexora Dashboard - Marketing Content

## X Posts

### Post 1 - The Hook
```
Built a full e-commerce dashboard with 6 pages in one sitting using v0

Not a mockup. Actual working Next.js code with charts, maps, tables, auth flows.

The iteration loop with AI is unreal now. Describe what you want, watch it materialize, tweak in real-time.

This is how we build in 2026.

### Post 2 - The Process Story
```
Went from blank canvas to production-ready admin dashboard using v0

The workflow:
- Dropped a reference screenshot
- Asked for a premium cream aesthetic
- Iterated on charts, added a world map, built out subpages

Total mass prompting time: couple hours
Lines of code I wrote manually: zero

AI makes this trivial now.

```

### Post 3 - The Technical Flex
```
What v0 just generated for me:

- Next.js 15 App Router with 6 routes
- Recharts bar/area/donut charts
- MapLibre GL world map with markers
- Full customer and order tables with filters
- Profile page with settings
- Consistent design system throughout

All from natural language prompts. The code is clean too.

### Post 4 - The Builder Insight
```
Hot take: designing in Figma then rebuilding in code is dead

With v0 I just describe the vibe I want and iterate directly in working code. Change colors, swap layouts, add features - all conversational.

Shipped this entire dashboard template without touching a design tool once.

### Post 5 - The Speed Story
```
Used to take me a week to scaffold a dashboard like this

With v0 the entire thing came together in an afternoon:
- 6 fully designed pages
- Interactive data visualizations  
- World map with country revenue on hover
- Responsive down to mobile

Zero to shipped. AI changed the game.

### Post 6 - The Casual Share
```
Just dropped a new template on v0

Rexora - premium e-commerce analytics dashboard

Clean cream and sage aesthetic. Charts that actually work. A world map because why not.

Built the whole thing with AI prompts. Code is open, grab it if you need a starting point for your next admin panel.

### Post 7 - The Iteration Story
```
The thing about building with v0 that nobody talks about:

You can be wrong fast

Tried three different color palettes, two chart layouts, and a completely different nav structure before landing on this dashboard design

Each iteration took seconds not hours. That changes how you think about building.

## LinkedIn Post

```
Spent the afternoon building a complete e-commerce dashboard using v0.dev

6 pages. Interactive charts. A world map with hover states. Customer tables. Order management. The works.

What struck me: the iteration speed completely changes how you approach design decisions. Instead of committing to a direction and building it out over days, you can explore multiple approaches in minutes.

Tried a dark theme first - didn't feel right. Switched to a cream aesthetic with sage accents. Looked better. Refined the spacing. Added the map on a whim because I could.

This is what building with AI actually feels like now. Not "AI writes code for me" but "AI lets me think at the speed of ideas."

Template is live if anyone needs a starting point for their next admin panel.
